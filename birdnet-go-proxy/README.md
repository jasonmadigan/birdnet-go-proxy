# Home Assistant Add-on: Birdnet-go Ingress Proxy

This addon creates a proxy to any addressable container, so you can benefit from having access to locally running web-UI's via Home Assistant. Useful for when you want to embed UIs in your Home Assistant sidebars for containers that are only addressable locally, so you can view these apps remotely.

This is based on work originally created by the Frigate project with their Frigate Proxy addon.
